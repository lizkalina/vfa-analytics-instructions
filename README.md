# Exercise 1: Set up Google Analytics
This exercise walks you through embedding Google Analytics on the music fanpage we worked on earlier. It will help you to better understand how your site connects to and tracks user interactions with Google Analytics.

#### STEP 1: Sign up for a Google Analytics account
Go to https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/ and click `Start for Free`. You'll need to fill out some basic information about your site. The only important field is the Website URL, which should match the URL you see in your browser's address bar. When you're ready, click `Get Tracking ID`

#### STEP 2: Copy your tracking code
Now let's copy the text in the textbox under `Global Site Tag`. We need to embed this bit of Javascript code on your fanpage. This is what connects your fanpage and Google Analytics. Whenever a user interactions with your site, tracking info is sent back to Google Analytics.

#### STEP 3: Embed the tracking code on your fanpage
Paste the copied tracking code from STEP 2 between the '<head>' and '</head>' tags in index.html. Once this is done, click `Open in New Browser` in the upper right hand corner.

Your fanpage should launch. Notice that there are no visible updates to your site! All the magic happens behind the scenes.

#### STEP 4: Check out your traffic LIVE! 
Now go to the `Realtime -> Overview` section on your Google Analytics dashboard. You should see that there is 1 active user (IT'S YOU) with additional info on your geography, pageviews, etc. Don't fret if you don't see this immediately - it may take a moment to sync.
